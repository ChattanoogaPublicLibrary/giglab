The Chattanooga Public Library has had access to gigabit speed internet since 2012. The 4th Floor is ["bathed in connectivity"](http://chattlibrary.org/content/inclusive-gigabit-libraries) to use the words of Nate Hill, the library's deputy director. The GigLab builds on top of this bandwidth ubiquity in a way that provides a separate but inclusive gig-connected space designed specifically for gigabit-related experimentation and learning.

We'll do this by offering access to enterprise-level [gigabit connected hardware](http://giglab.io/resources) to the general public, as well as a variety of short-session and hands on courses regarding networking as a whole, and all things gigabit focused. We're going to post a full list of courses we're developing soon, so follow us on Twitter! And please feel free to submit your own ideas!

We view the gig as one of the 21st century's most inspiring and potential-filled platforms for innovation and collaboration. We hope the GigLab serves as a catalyst for this platform's continued development, and the general public's continued learning.

We plan to officially launch the GigLab as a publicly accessible space in early November. But if you're interested in signing up to lead a session or volunteering to help set the place up, [we'd love to hear from you](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qU8K7jnsD6kkoX0X7lZXtUC90iVvtWDWdYQ-uM4ZrUs/viewform?usp=send_form). In the mean time, [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/giglabcha) for frequent updates about setup and the latest gig-related developments.
