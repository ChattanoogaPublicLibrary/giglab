GigLab is pretty late into our Mozilla pilot period, and on the outside we don't have a lot to show for it. But developing a space like this has a lot of moving parts! I'm writing this to the tune of clanking pipes and grinding steel as electricians upgrade the 4th Floor's electricity to support the added load of The GigLab*. This ensures both The 4th Floor and The GigLab have room to grow.

We've been dealing with multiple vendors and funding sources, including most recently The Tennessee Library Association, to fill The GigLab with amazing gig-enabled equipment. Check out our [resources list](http://blog.giglab.io/resources) to see the resources we're going to be offering. That should be enough to get you excited about our launch event on November 8th! We'll post more details about this as they become available, but until then keep an eye on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/giglabcha) for more frequent updates. Also, feel free to come see our demo at the Creative Discovery Museum on Thursday, October the 9th from 5:30 to 7:30. This is a free admissions day, and many other amazing Gigabit Community Fund projects will also be in attendance. Hope to see you there!
