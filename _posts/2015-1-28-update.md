GigLab will be holding its first class on Hadoop on Wednesday Feb. 18 from 5 to 7pm! This lesson is a hands on lab developed by Joe France (@joefrance) that teaches the basics of Hadoop.


There's no age limit to attend, but basic profeciency in using the UNIX terminal is suggested. GigLab will have Chromebooks available for the lesson, so there's no need to bring a personal laptop.
