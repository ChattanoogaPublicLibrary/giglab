      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Chattanooga Public Library has had access to gigabit speed internet since 2012. The 4th Floor is &lt;a href=&quot;http://chattlibrary.org/content/inclusive-gigabit-libraries&quot;&gt;“bathed in connectivity”&lt;/a&gt; to use the words of Nate Hill, the library’s deputy director. The GigLab builds on top of this bandwidth ubiquity in a way that provides a separate but inclusive gig-connected space designed specifically for gigabit-related experimentation and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll do this by offering access to enterprise-level &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.giglab.io/resources&quot;&gt;gigabit connected hardware&lt;/a&gt; to the general public, as well as a variety of short-session and hands on courses regarding networking as a whole, and all things gigabit focused. We’re going to post a full list of courses we’re developing soon, so follow us on Twitter! And please feel free to submit your own ideas!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We view the gig as one of the 21st century’s most inspiring and potential-filled platforms for innovation and collaboration. We hope the GigLab serves as a catalyst for this platform’s continued development, and the general public’s continued learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We plan to officially launch the GigLab as a publicly accessible space in early November. But if you’re interested in signing up to lead a session or volunteering to help set the place up, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qU8K7jnsD6kkoX0X7lZXtUC90iVvtWDWdYQ-uM4ZrUs/viewform?usp=send_form&quot;&gt;we’d love to hear from you&lt;/a&gt;. In the mean time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/giglabcha&quot;&gt;follow us on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for frequent updates about setup and the latest gig-related developments.
